		Spivakov. It was a very simple program that showed Bible verses on the 
		screen in church. He also added ability to show song. In early 2009, one 
		more developer, Vladislav Kobzar has joined the programming. By now, 
		plans for have been set to rewrite initial program and call it &quot;softProject&quot;. 
		So the writing has started again and in spring of 2009 fist development 
		release of soft projector has been released. During summer of 2009, 
		one more developer has joined the team, Matvey Adzhigirey, and with his 
		help, in the fall first alpha 
		release of softProjector has been released to the public and in spring 
		of 2010 first beta version has been made available. With Gods help and 
		wisdom, many changes improvements has been made, many new features has 
		been added, while keeping it simple and easy to use, but still powerful.
